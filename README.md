# feslib
Thermodinamics, phase transitions, appications for different fluids, equations of state."

## Description

**feslib** provides several functions and example scripts for investigation of phase transitions.
Several different equations of state are being investigated.
The library is based on the results of articles by Valentin Lychagin, his students and colleagues.

#### Contribute
This code is still under development and benchmarking. If you find any bugs or errors in the code, please report them in GitHub.

For this code, we work on the develop branch and merge it to the main branch (with a new version number) everytime significant addtions/improvements are made. If you plan on making contributions, please base everything on the develop branch.

### Benchmarks
